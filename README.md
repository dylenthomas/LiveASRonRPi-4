# LARS
#### Live Asr on Raspberry-pi S (LARS)

codebase to run ASR on a raspberry pi 4 and control smart relays with it.

current plan is to have c++ code interact with the microphones and have python code run inference on the data they collect.
to easily run the python code in the raspberry pi just have a default activated conda environment with all the libraries.
