Software for running whistle detection model on raspberry pi - whisper.

IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
  -Add the second microphone above my door
  -Test a CNN-TCN model to detect whistles like in the image: CNN-TCN Classifier from https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.28.620665 (except for the CNN ResNet might be a better choice)
