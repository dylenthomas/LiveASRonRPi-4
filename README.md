# LARS
### Live Asr with a Raspberry-pi as the end device and a dGPU on a Server doing all the heavy lifting (LARS)

codebase to run ASR on a raspberry pi 4 and control smart relays with it.

This current version is using an altered version of faster-whisper where it bypasses the audio file transcription and just takes already processed audio.
