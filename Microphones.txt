To combine microphones try using Delay-Sum Beamforming: http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/audio/beamforming/delaySum.html

To get the delay use the cross correlation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation, or:
  In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two series 
  as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other.

Then once the delay between microphone signals is found, sum them together and we have the single microphone singal.
